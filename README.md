Runs a "Board Game" server with a SQLite database and board game images.
The angular "app" is a minimal example of requesting the data.

Requirements: NodeJS - http://nodejs.org/

```
1. 'npm install' to install packages
2. 'gulp' to get the server running
```

During the workshop, we'll start from scratch and refactor as we go along, but we included the "src" and "dist" folders as a reference for some techniques.

```
optional: 'gulp watch' will watch the 'src' and build into a 'dist' directory
```
